# glTF Experience Format (glXF) Extension Registry

## Ratified Khronos Extensions

Khronos extensions use the reserved `KHR` prefix. Once ratified by the Khronos Group, they are covered by the Khronos IP framework. Extensions that are intended to be ratified can also use the `KHR` prefix to avoid name/code/version thrashing. Khronos members can submit an extension for ratification, which is then voted on by the Khronos Board of Promoters.

The following extensions have been ratified by the Khronos Group:

* None

## Multi-Vendor Extensions

When an extension is implemented by more than one vendor, its name can use the reserved `EXT` prefix. Multi-vendor extensions are not covered by the Khronos IP framework.

* None

## Vendor Extensions

The list of vendor prefixes is maintained in the main glTF repo, [Prefixes.md](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/Prefixes.md). Any vendor, not just Khronos members, can request an extension prefix by submitting an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues/new) requesting one.  Requests should include:

* The name of the prefix.
* The name of the vendor requesting the prefix.
* The vendor's URL and/or contact information.

Vendor extensions are not covered by the Khronos IP framework.

* None
